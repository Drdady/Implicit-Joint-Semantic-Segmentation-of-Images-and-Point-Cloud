## Configuration of conda env

./conda_env/py2.yml <br>
./conda_env/py3.yml <br>

```
conda env export > py2.yml
conda env create -f py2.yml
```


## Pre-processing part
```
./main.py
```
pre-processing code for aerial imagery and LiDAR point cloud, including 3D-2D projection, frustum culling, 
Hidden-point-removal (HPR), gird interpolation and operator of Morphology.

```
./utilities.py
```
functions of each of algorithms implemented in pre-processing.

```
./myClasses.py
```
some classes related to frustum culling, traslated from C++ code, detailed explanation in OpenGL.

```
./visualization.py
```
functions used to visualize data. 

```
./statistics.py
```
functions used to calculate statistic information of the data.

```
./Generation_depth_img.py
```
code for generating depth image.

## Deep learning part
```
./version_playground
```
Old code backup, including point splatting achieved in C++ if you needed.<br>

```
./semantic-segmentation/Models/
```
* SegNet (main model used in thesis)
* U-net (not test)
* TernausNet (not test)

```
./semantic-segmentation/board/
```
where you save tensorboard file.

```
./semantic-segmentation/data/
```
where you save train/validation/test-set and VGG pre-treained weights.

```
./semantic-segmentation/weights/
```
where you save trained weights.

```
./semantic-segmentation/pytorch_code/
```
some dirty code of SegNet and pre-processing implemented in pytorch. 

### Code:
```
./semantic-segmentation/train.py
./semantic-segmentation/prediction.py
```
train and prediction your data.

```
./semantic-segmentation/LoadBatches.py
```
data generator with pre-processing such as normalization, random rotation, random cropping

```
./semantic-segmentation/chip.py
```
cropping images if you need.

```
./semantic-segmentation/evaluation.py
```
evaluation semantic result in 2D and 3D space.
